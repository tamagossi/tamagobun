No, the title is wrong. This is not my first blog ever. I have written some back then when I was in highschool hoping making some little amount of money through adsense (You might remember blogger was hype back then)

# 1 -- The Motivation

This year I gather all the motivation I have been accumulating in the past years and I realize several things:

1. Writing help you think better
2. Writing is one of the methods to recall what you have learnt
3. Writing enable you to give impact to your surrounding
4. Writing is one way to introduce your skillset to the world

## 1.1 -- Writing help you think better

<hr />

There's a lot of books that I have read that supports this claims, there is a journal that provides a strong evidence about this. One of this is a 2007 study published in the journal _CBE-Life Sciences Education_, The researched titled "Learning to Improve: Using Writing to Increase Critical Thinking Performance in General Education Biology" shows that writing can improve critical thinking skills in students. The study found that students who wrote regularly improved their critical thinking abilities compared to those who did not.

For me, writing me force beyond recalling what I have read or watched, it force me to think about the problem and the solution, and how I sysnthesize it with my daily life. That when the information coming throught my mind become useful, and it become stickier in my mind. Writing (while also reading) also makes me realize and thinking about the problem in a more structured way. Because when you write, you have an encouragment to deliver ideas in a way that easy to understand for other people.

## 1.2 -- Writing is one of the methods to recall what you have learnt

<hr />

As I mentioned previously, while we are writing, our brain is being forced to remember the things that we have read/learnt/watched. And it force you beyond only remembering it, it force you to recall and understand it.

Writing can be the method to practice learning. in the book of _Make it Stick: The Science of Successful Learning_, in the second chapter, and the forth chapter, the author mention about _Retrieval Practice_, and _Elaboration Practice_ which are the two methods of effective learning. When we are talking about writing, it includes both of them. While we are writing, we absolutely need to retrieve everything, and after that we need to elaborate it in our own word and trying to address our dea to other people

## 1.3 -- Writing enable you to give impact to your surrounding

<hr />

You will never know that everything that you have known will have an impact to your surrounding until you spread it to other people. Some people might found that your idea is helpful, some people might found the insight after reading your writing. Some people might feel calm, some people might stop crying because of it. We never know. But I think most of us have experienced that we found the impact after reading someone else's writing.

Myself in particular, I oftenly feels motivated after reading a financial freedom book. While getting more information about how to reach the financial freedom, I also found that I feel encouraged to work more efficient and smart. Or while reading a book about software softskill like _Learning System Thinking_, I found myself feels someting strange, a rooler coaster. Sometimes it hards me in the face, sometimes it makes me feel like I need to learn more.

## 1.4 -- Writing is one way to introduce your skillset to the world

<hr />

I think we have experienced this... which, being rejected by HR when applying a job, after applying a job to another, we still have no received any job offers. But, in other universe, there is a person that received a lot of job offers without putting an effort to applying in every open Linkedin jobpost. If you asking me why I will answer your question with a very simple answer, they brand themselves through writing. They show their abilties to the outside world, and how they solve the problem through writing, hence people trust that they can do a good job and solve the problems

<br />

While, this is my first babbling blog. Will continue writing and this is my first step to do so. Until next time, keep learning.
