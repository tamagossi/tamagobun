No, the title is wrong. This is not my first blog ever. I wrote some back in high school, hoping to make a little money through adsense (You might remember blogger was hype back then)

This year, something clicked. After years of collecting motivation from books, articles, and conversations, I finally decided to act on it.

I started writing consistently, expecting it would just improve my communication skills. But what I discovered surprised me—writing wasn't just about putting words on paper. It was rewiring how I think, learn, and connect with others.

Here are the four biggest insights that changed everything:

1. How Writing Rewires Your Brain
2. The Memory Hack That Actually Works
3. The Ripple Effect of Sharing You Thoughts
4. Writing Can be My Best resume

## How Writing Rewires Your Brain

Let me start with the most suprising discovery-how writing literally changes the way your brain works.

I've read many books that support this claim, there is a journal that provides a strong evidence about this. One of this is a 2007 study published in the journal _CBE-Life Sciences Education_, The researched titled "Learning to Improve: Using Writing to Increase Critical Thinking Performance in General Education Biology" shows that writing can improve critical thinking skills in students. The study found that students who wrote regularly improved their critical thinking abilities compared to those who did not.

For me, writing forces me to go beyond recalling what I have read or watched, it force me to think about the problem and the solution, and how I synthesize it with my daily life. That's when the information flowing through my mind becomes useful, and it become stickier in my mind. Writing (while also reading) also makes me realize and thinking about the problem in a more structured way. Because when you write, you're encouraged to deliver ideas in a way that easy to understand for other people.

But cognitive benefits are just the beginning. Writing also solves a problem we all face: forgetting what we learn.

## The Memory Hack That Actually Works

As I mentioned previously, while we are writing, our brain is being forced to remember the things that we have read/learnt/watched. And it force you beyond only remembering it, it force you to recall and understand it.

Writing can be the method to practice learning. in the book _Make it Stick: The Science of Successful Learning_, in the second chapter, and the fouth chapter, the author mention about _Retrieval Practice_, and _Elaboration Practice_ which are the two methods of effective learning. When we are talking about writing, it includes both of them. While we are writing, we absolutely need to retrieve everything, and after that we need to elaborate it in our own word and trying to address our ideas to other people

Now, here's where things get really interesting. All this personal growth through writing? It doesn't just benefit you.

## The Ripple Effect of Sharing You Thoughts

You will never know that everything that you have known will have an impact to your surrounding until you spread it to other people. Some people might found that your idea is helpful, some people might found the insight after reading your writing. Some people might feel calm, some people might stop crying because of it. We never know. But I think most of us have experienced that we found the impact after reading someone else's writing.

Myself in particular, I oftenly feel motivated after reading a financial freedom book. While getting more information about how to reach the financial freedom, I also found that I feel encouraged to work more efficient and smart. Or while reading a book about software softskill like _Learning System Thinking_, I found myself feel something strange, a roller coaster. Sometimes it hits me hard in the face, sometimes it makes me feel like I need to learn more.

And if helping others isn't motivation enough, here's the practical benefit for you:

## Writing Can be My Best resume

I think we have experienced this... which, being rejected by HR when applying a job, after applying a job to another, we still have no received any job offers. But, in other universe, there is a person that received a lot of job offers without putting an effort to applying in every open Linkedin jobpost. If you asking me why I will answer your question with a very simple answer, they build their brand themselves through writing. They show their abilties to the outside world, and how they solve the problem through writing, hence people trust that they can do a good job and solve the problems

This is just the beginning of my writing journey, and honestly, I'm excited about what comes next. Every post is a chance to think more clearly, remember more effectively, and maybe—just maybe—make a difference in someone's day.

If you've been thinking about starting to write, take this as your sign. You don't need to be perfect. You just need to start.

Until next time, keep learning
