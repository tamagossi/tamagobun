I joined <a href="https://www.smooets.com/">Smooets</a> right after graduating from university. At that time, my financial situation wasn’t in good shape, which put me in a position where I had very limited options to explore job opportunities. The only decision I could take was to <strong>get a job as soon as possible</strong>.

Around the same time, some of my friends had already secured offers from well-known startups like <strong>Gojek</strong> and <strong>Bukalapak</strong>. I used to think I was on the same level as them — at least in terms of logic and problem-solving. In our final-year quizzes, I often finished faster. That fed a <em>quiet belief that I deserved similar opportunities</em>. What I failed to see back then was <strong>everything outside the quiz room</strong>. They were disciplined, consistently curious, and deliberate about how they navigated university. I wasn’t. I only started taking coding seriously in my final year, mostly out of necessity, not intention. Looking back, <strong>it wasn’t confidence — it was arrogance</strong>.

## The Job Hunting Began

Like most people searching for a job, I opened my laptop, browsed the internet, and started applying. I sent applications to several companies through <u>LinkedIn</u>, <u>JobStreet</u>, and whatever job listing platforms I could find. A few responses came back as offers, <em>many more as rejections</em>.

I remember receiving an offer from a company in Jakarta. For a fresh graduate, it was a decent offer. But at that time, <strong>I was stubborn</strong> — I wanted to work in Bandung, the city I was living in then. So I turned it down. After a few rounds of job hunting, I eventually landed an interview with <a href="https://geeksfarm.com/">GeeksFarm</a>, a company that gathered talent around Bandung and connected them with other companies.

Eventually, GeeksFarm directed me to work at Smooets. At that time, I didn’t know much about the company. I hadn’t really researched it beforehand — all I knew was, “Okay, it’s based in Bandung, and it’s close to where I live. <strong>GREAT!!</strong>”

It turned out that Smooets was an outsourcing company, which meant I could be assigned to clients in different cities depending on the project. <em>That surprised me.</em> I hadn’t realized that moving from one city to another might be part of the job. During the final interview, I asked to not be placed outside Bandung, and they agreed. I signed the contract, and that’s how the cooperation began.

## Swimming to The Shore

After signing the contract, I wasn’t assigned to any project right away. For a while, all I did was explore — the codebase, the environment, the tools, and the people. I was trying to make myself useful while waiting for something concrete to land. Around that time, the company also gave me a work laptop. My own laptop wasn’t great for coding back then, so I secretly had high expectations. <em>Maybe a MacBook Pro?</em> Reality, of course, had other plans. The specs were almost identical to mine. I remember thinking, _well… I might as well keep using my own._

A few weeks later, the first assignment finally came. The catch was that it required me to work from a different location. Thankfully, it was still within the same city. I was assigned to a sister company, <a href="https://www.wgs.co.id/"><strong>Walden Global Services</strong></a>, commonly known as WGS. I still remember my first day — being told to go there without much introduction, no clear onboarding, and no familiar face waiting. I walked in feeling like a <strong>lost chick trying to find its mother</strong>. Luckily, a kind person welcomed me in. He later turned out to be my project manager. That small gesture mattered more than he probably realized — <em>it softened the loneliness and made the place feel a little less intimidating</em>.

The first project I was assigned to was a web application for a client in Jakarta. It was a CRUD-style application built with <strong>Angular</strong> — <em>“simple” only in theory</em>. The client was <a href="https://www.sinarmas.com/">Sinarmas</a>, one of the largest companies in Indonesia. The goal was to build a dashboard that recorded activities related to their biotechnology business and distributed the data across different organizational layers. Before this system existed, most of the reporting lived in Excel files and paper documents. After it went live, data became centralized, reporting errors were reduced, and internal teams could access synchronized information without manual coordination.

I was asked to start the project from scratch — <strong>without a mentor</strong>. At one point, I had to decide the entire tech stack, folder structure, and overall setup on my own — not because I was ready, but because there was no one else to ask. Looking back, I still don’t fully understand why I was trusted with that responsibility. I was a fresh graduate with no experience in choosing tech stacks, no real understanding of trade-offs, and far too confident that whatever I had just learned was <em>“the best way.”</em> But the project had to move forward, and it did. There was no playbook, no guidance, not even a standard for commit messages. I remember once committing with the message _“Ah akhirnya semua beres”_ (“Ah, finally everything is done”). One of the senior people noticed and asked why I wrote it that way. I remember thinking, <em>then why didn’t anyone tell me what the right way was?</em>

Despite all that, I managed to carry the project through until the end of my assignment. I was eventually replaced by someone else after what was, unofficially, a kind of promotion — I’ll get to that later. Years later, though, a different realization stuck with me. There was a backend engineer everyone referred to as “senior,” mostly because he had been around for years and could work with whatever stack he was assigned. But seniority there didn’t seem to be about maturity or technical depth. It felt more like a measure of how many projects you could handle and how useful you were to the company. Every API in that project was a `POST` — create, update, delete, even read. REST semantics didn’t matter. He used Postman for everything, which felt fitting, because <strong>he was the _POST_ man</strong>.

It took me years to understand why that bothered me — and what it taught me.

## An Unexpected Promotion

After going through that initial struggle, I turned into what some might call a "bad employee" — but in the best possible way. I started questioning everything. I would constantly ask, _“Why isn't there a standard?”_ or _“Why was it written this way?”_ I didn't just keep these frustrations to myself; I tried to influence the colleagues closest to me, telling them about what "proper engineering" should look like.

But not everyone listened, and for a long time, I wondered why. I was naive. I judged them based on what I saw — colleagues who preferred playing games after work rather than chasing the next technical challenge. I assumed they didn't want to grow. It took time to realize the actual lesson: <strong>if you want to develop yourself, you need to swim in a larger aquarium</strong>. I needed a place where competition was natural and where everyone around me was <u>hungry to be better than they were yesterday</u>.

Eventually, I decided it was time to leave and look for a better opportunity. I went to management and told them I wanted to resign, even though my contract was still active.

To my surprise, their response wasn't a goodbye — <strong>it was a counter-offer</strong>. Because I had been so vocal about standards, they assumed I could lead others to follow them. They asked me to become a "Team Lead." The role was simple on paper: manage a few developers across different projects and teach them how to write code properly. And yes, I accepted the offer rather than paying a penalty for breaking the contract. Plus, for every developer I managed, I earned a little extra.

For a while, the arrangement worked. I felt valued. But slowly, I realized I was being used as a face for the clients. When pitching for new projects, the company would put my name forward, leveraging my portfolio which was stronger than the newer employees. It was a clever strategy—using my credentials to increase the winning rate.

But behind the scenes, other developers were doing the actual work. I wasn't just leading; I was a figurehead. At the time, it felt dishonest, almost like cheating. <em>Why sell my experience if I’m not the one delivering it?</em> Yet, looking back, I understand the survival instinct. They needed projects to stay alive, and this was the card they had to play. It wasn't personal; it was just business.

## The Impact And Leasson Learned

Despite everything, I remain grateful to the company. I may not have gained the kind of technical mentorship or engineering culture I originally craved, but I gained something else: <strong>perspective</strong>. The experience forced me to reflect on my own arrogance, the realities of business survival, and the difference between just writing code and actually building a career. It wasn't the lesson I wanted, but it was the lesson I needed. Smooets taught me that being a “good engineer” isn’t about fancy algorithms or clever tricks, but about responsibility — understanding who depends on your work and what breaks if you get it wrong.

And beyond the lessons, there were the people. I remember coaching one junior who struggled to translate logical thinking into actual code. We broke problems down together, step by step, until it clicked. Seeing that shift — from confusion to confidence — was the first time I realized teaching was a skill of its own. I tried to leave good memories with the developers I managed, and <em>many of them remain my good friends today</em>.
