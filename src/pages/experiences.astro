              I’ve had a few roles over the years — some short, some longer — and I learned
              something from each of them. Different environments taught me different lessons, and
              none of them were wasted. But when it comes to full-time work — the kind that shapes
              your habits, judgment, and day-to-day thinking — the chapters that defined most of my
              professional journey were

              Joining smooets was a shift from pure product development to high-scale
              infrastructure. I came in right when the platform was hitting its first major
              scalability bottleneck. The monolithic architecture that served the startup well was
              starting to crumble under the weight of 5 million daily active users.

            <p>
              My role wasn't just to write Go microservices; it was to advocate for a culture of
              reliability. I led the "Resiliency First" initiative, introducing chaos engineering
              practices and observability standards that reduced our incident response time by 60%.
              It taught me that technical excellence is as much about people and process as it is
              about code.

              Oryn was where I really understood the "Product" in Product Engineering. As employee
              #12, the lines between backend, frontend, and design were blurred. One day I was
              optimizing PostgreSQL queries, the next I was interviewing customers to understand why
              the onboarding flow was dropping off.

              I owned the entire payment infrastructure rebuild. We moved from a fragile,
              custom-built ledger to a robust Stripe Connect integration. This wasn't just a
              technical migration; it unlocked a new business model for the company, allowing us to
              support marketplace transactions for the first time.

              My start at a digital agency was trial by fire. We shipped a new project every 6
              weeks. It was fast, chaotic, and incredibly educational. I learned how to translate
              vague client requirements into pixel-perfect interfaces using React and the early days
              of Vue.js.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most significant takeaway was the importance of accessibility and performance. I
              championed an internal tooling library that standardized our accessibility practices,
              ensuring every site we shipped was navigable by everyone.

              Before the stable jobs, there was the hustle. Building WordPress sites for local
              businesses, fixing broken PHP scripts, and learning that "it works on my machine" is
              never a valid excuse. These years built my grit and my ability to figure things out
              independently.
