              I’ve had a few roles over the years — some short, some longer — and I learned
              something from each of them. Different environments taught me different lessons, and
              none of them were wasted. But when it comes to full-time work — the kind that shapes
              your habits, judgment, and day-to-day thinking — the chapters that defined most of my
              professional journey were

              </a>, I wasn’t happy.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was young, and I had ego. Back then, I thought I deserved to join a <em>
                “good startup.”
              </em>
              Something bigger. Something louder. Many of my friends who graduated around the same time
              were joining companies like <a
                class="font-bold"
                href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pt-bukalapak-com/"

              </a>, or other startups offering attractive salaries and shiny titles. Naturally, I
              compared. And naturally, I felt left behind.

              In 2018, the market treated programmers differently. Demand was high, supply was still
              relatively low, and companies were willing to pay a premium just to hire—or even
              steal—engineering talent. Against that backdrop, <strong>
                Smooets felt… ordinary
              </strong>. The offer was ok, the benefits were standard, and nothing about it felt
              special. This isn’t about believing IT graduates are better than others—but at that
              time, IT-related talent <em>was</em>
              <strong> genuinely in high demand </strong>, and the market made that very clear.
            </p>
            <p>I didn’t realize it then, but that contrast would matter more than I expected.</p>

              When I first interviewed with <a
                class="font-bold"
                href="https://staffinc.co/"

              </a>, I was genuinely excited.
            </p>
            <p>
              The conversations felt sharp, the people felt serious, and everything moved with
              intent. It looked like the kind of product company engineers talk about — strong
              technical discussions, modern stacks, and people who seemed to enjoy thinking deeply
              about systems. For someone who had been chasing better environments, it felt like I
              was <strong> finally stepping into the right room </strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              That excitement grew as I got to know the team. Many of the people I met were
              ambitious, opinionated in a good way, and came from strong academic backgrounds. There
              was a clear sense that expectations were high — <strong
                >not just to deliver, but to think</strong
              >. At that point in my career, being surrounded by smart people and sophisticated
              technology felt like progress. <em>It felt like momentum.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              And honestly, who doesn’t enjoy good benefits? <strong
                >My salary more than doubled.</strong
              > For the first time, I felt like I had entered the same “circle” as friends who graduated
              around the same time — the kind of circle I used to observe from a distance. Even if their
              numbers were still higher than mine, it <em>finally felt close enough to touch</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong> But a few years in </strong>, thinking only about technology started to feel
              <i>incomplete</i>. The work didn’t become boring — it became heavier. I started
              noticing how much effort it actually takes for a company to survive, not just to ship
              features. Questions I never cared about before became unavoidable: <strong>
                what’s the point of becoming a good programmer if it doesn’t generate revenue?</strong
              > What does technical excellence mean if it isn’t tied to ownership and consequence? That
              realization didn’t kill the excitement — it stripped away the illusion.

              Miscellaneous — Part-Time & Side Work
            </h2>

            <p>
              I started taking side projects for a simple reason: <strong> money </strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wasn’t starting from zero — <em>I was starting from minus</em>. I’m part of the <u>
                sandwich generation
              </u>, and for a long time, stability wasn’t guaranteed. I had responsibilities before
              savings, and plans before capital. I wanted to save, to eventually invest, and that
              required extra income. At that point in my life, side projects weren’t about ambition
              — <strong> they were about survival and momentum </strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, the reason expanded. Money still mattered, but something else quietly
              pulled me in: <strong> people </strong>. I’ve always loved learning languages, and
              hearing someone speak a foreign language — especially English — has always triggered
              something in me. Meeting native speakers through work made my heart race in a way I
              didn’t expect. I ended up working with people from <u>Argentina</u>, <u>
                South Africa
              </u>, <u>the UK</u>, and <u>Ireland</u>. For someone who grew up in a small city in
              Indonesia, that was never part of the plan. <em>It just… happened.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking back, those side projects weren’t about career strategy or polishing a
              profile. They were about <strong> staying curious </strong>, <strong>
                staying connected
              </strong>, and proving to myself that <em>
                the world was bigger than the few places I had known
              </em>. That feeling is still what keeps me moving.
