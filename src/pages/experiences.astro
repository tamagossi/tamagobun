              I’ve had a few roles over the years — some short, some longer — and I learned
              something from each of them. Different environments taught me different lessons, and
              none of them were wasted. But when it comes to full-time work — the kind that shapes
              your habits, judgment, and day-to-day thinking — the chapters that defined most of my
              professional journey were

              </a>, I wasn’t happy.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was young, and I had ego. Back then, I thought I deserved to join a “good startup.”
              Something bigger. Something louder. Many of my friends who graduated around the same
              time were joining companies like <a
                class="font-bold"
                href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pt-bukalapak-com/"

                href="https://www.gojek.com/en-id"

              </a>, or other startups offering attractive salaries and shiny titles. Naturally, I
              compared. And naturally, I felt left behind.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2018, the market treated programmers differently. Demand was high, supply was still
              relatively low, and companies were willing to pay a premium just to hire—or even
              steal—engineering talent. Against that backdrop, Smooets felt… ordinary. The offer was
              reasonable, the benefits were standard, and nothing about it felt special. This isn’t
              about believing IT graduates are better than others—but at that time, IT-related
              talent <em>was</em> genuinely in high demand, and the market made that very clear.

            <p>I didn’t realize it then, but that contrast would matter more than I expected.</p>
