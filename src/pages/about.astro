              I’ve been a software engineer since 2018. And yes — still am.

            </h2>
            <p>What’s funny is, I never planned to be one.</p>
            <p>
              When I entered university, I didn’t fully understand what <em
                >“information technology”</em
              > meant. I just knew computers existed, and somehow I spent most of my days around them.
              When a teacher asked me to choose a major, I picked almost randomly. Graphic design didn’t
              feel right. Information technology sounded… close enough.
            </p>
            <p>That decision turned out to matter more than I expected.</p>
            <p>
              I didn’t fall in love with software overnight. I grew into it. Slowly. Mostly by
              breaking things. I learned that mistakes are allowed — even encouraged — as long as
              you can undo them, understand them, and do better next time. That mindset stayed with
              me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Software engineering became practical in the most honest sense. It pays the bills. I
              don’t romanticize that. But I respect it. This job gave me stability, leverage, and a
              way to keep learning without standing still.
            </p>
            <div class={cn('w-full h-px', 'my-10', 'bg-border-light dark:bg-border-dark')}></div>
            <h2 class={cn('mt-16 mb-6 text-3xl')} id="approach">Approach &amp; Perspective</h2>
            <p>Over time, learning shaped how I approach problems.</p>
            <p>
              I don’t usually start from code. I start from the problem itself — trying to
              understand the system, the constraints, and the people involved. From there, I break
              things down layer by layer until the structure makes sense, or until it clearly
              doesn’t.
            </p>
            <p>
              I care more about clarity than cleverness, and more about decisions than tools.
              Shipping features is not the hard part. Understanding <em>why</em> a feature should exist,
              and what it might break later, is where the real work happens.
            </p>
            <p>That’s the part I enjoy most.</p>
            <div class={cn('w-full h-px', 'my-10', 'bg-border-light dark:bg-border-dark')}></div>
            <h2 class={cn('mt-16 mb-6 text-3xl scroll-mt-28')} id="craft">Work &amp; Craft</h2>
            <p>In practice, I work across both frontend and backend, mostly on web applications.</p>
            <p>
              On the frontend, I frequently use Next.js together with React, Tailwind CSS, React
              Query, and Zustand. I choose these tools not because they’re trendy, but because they
              help me reason clearly about UI behavior, state, and data flow.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the backend, I work with Go, often using Fiber, focusing on APIs that are explicit,
              predictable, and easy to evolve over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don’t draw a strict line between frontend and backend. What matters more to me is
              how the pieces fit together, where complexity should live, and how systems behave as
              they grow.
            </p>
            <div class={cn('w-full h-px', 'my-10', 'bg-border-light dark:bg-border-dark')}></div>
            <h2 class={cn('mt-16 mb-6 text-3xl')} id="curiosity">Direction &amp; Curiosity</h2>
            <p>Right now, I live in Indonesia. But I don’t think locally by default.</p>
            <p>
              I’m curious about how people build systems elsewhere — maybe Malaysia, Singapore,
              Japan, or the Middle East. Not because moving abroad is a trophy, but because
              different places force different trade-offs. And trade-offs are where real learning
              happens.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of programming languages, I also enjoy learning human languages. There’s
              something oddly satisfying about it — discovering new structure, nuance, and ways of
              thinking. It scratches the same part of my brain.
            </p>
            <div class={cn('w-full h-px', 'my-10', 'bg-border-light dark:bg-border-dark')}></div>
            <p>
              You’ll notice this page doesn’t list achievements or buzzwords. That’s intentional.
              This site is about how I think, how I work, and how I keep growing — not just what
              I’ve done.
